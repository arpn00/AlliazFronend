Growth data in the Eurozone strengthened the case\n      for a soft landing scenario, followed by a shy recovery. Powell\u2019s\n      testimony to the Congress also relieved markets, due to fears that the\n      recent upside surprises in inflation could trigger a hawkish shift, though\n      that didn\u2019t happen. Central bankers reemphasised that rate cuts require\n      compelling evidence of disinflation, as avoiding a dovish mistake remains\n      top of mind. Unfortunately, the US job reports last week were \u201crather\n      ambiguous\u201d (as mentioned by our colleagues in the US), nonfarm payrolls\n      rose 275k in February, above the 200k forecast, but there were 167k of\n      downward revisions to the past two months, so the net improvement was\n      little more than 100k. Still, this was better than the ISM employment\n      indices, which were both in contraction territory. On balance, weaker job\n      reports are consistent with a likely cut in June. Both EUR and USD rates\n      bull flattened during the week, depicting expectations of disinflation\n      amidst slower growth. \\n \\n Rule 3) If the text contains more than 250\n      tokens, summarize it to the most relevant parts so that it is less than\n      250 tokens.",
